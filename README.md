# Blink Attack Plugin for PLCTool - A PRIME/DLMS graphical swiss-knife

This repostory contains the source code of the sample **Blink Attack Plugin** for **PLCTool**, a Qt-based graphical tool used to analyze and debug PRIME / DLMS-based smart-meter networks, with special focus on the security of these deployments.

Currently, **we support GNU/Linux and probably other Unix-based environments.** Windows support is on its way.

This tool was presented in the talk **Hacking Smart Meters** of the RootedCON 2022, during which its use with the **ATPL360-EK** evaluation kit to send and receive data in PLC networks was demonstrated.
